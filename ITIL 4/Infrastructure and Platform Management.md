The infrastructure and platform management practice plays a critical role within an organisation's IT service management strategy. Its primary objective is to provide comprehensive oversight and governance over the infrastructure and platforms employed by the organisation. By effectively executing this practice, the organisation gains the capability to monitor and control the entire spectrum of technology solutions at its disposal, encompassing both internal infrastructure and external service providers.

At its core, this practice involves a systematic approach to the planning, deployment, operation, and continual improvement of all infrastructure elements and technology platforms. It entails meticulous coordination and collaboration across various teams, such as IT operations, development, security, and procurement, to ensure seamless integration and optimal utilisation of resources.

The first key aspect of this practice involves mapping out the technology landscape of the organisation. It necessitates a comprehensive inventory of all hardware, software, networking components, and cloud-based services utilised to support the delivery of IT services. This step enables a clear understanding of the organisation's technological assets and lays the foundation for efficient management.

Once the technology landscape is documented, the practice focuses on ensuring that the infrastructure and platforms align with the organisation's business objectives and service requirements. By closely evaluating these aspects, IT leaders can make informed decisions about technology investments, upgrades, and decommissioning obsolete systems. The goal is to maintain a future-proof, agile, and cost-effective technology environment that can readily adapt to changing business needs.

## What is the Objective of Infrastructure and Platform Management?
