### Summary of Section 4.4: Governance

#### 4.4.1 Governing Bodies and Governance

**Key Message**: Every organization is directed by a governing body, which is accountable at the highest level for the organization's performance and compliance. This body can be a board of directors or executive managers who take on governance roles when performing governance activities.

**Organizational Governance**:
- **Evaluate**: The governing body evaluates the organization, its strategy, portfolios, and relationships with other parties. This evaluation is continuous as stakeholder needs and external circumstances evolve.
- **Direct**: The governing body assigns responsibility and directs the preparation and implementation of organizational strategy and policies. Strategies guide organizational activity and investments, while policies establish behavioral requirements for the organization, suppliers, partners, and other stakeholders.
- **Monitor**: The governing body monitors the performance of the organization and its practices, products, and services to ensure alignment with policies and direction.

These governance activities (evaluate, direct, and monitor) are applied to all aspects of the organization, including service management.

#### 4.4.2 Governance in the SVS

**Role and Position**: The role and position of governance within the ITIL Service Value System (SVS) depend on how the SVS is applied in the organization. The SVS can be applied to the organization as a whole or to individual units or products. Some organizations delegate governance activities to different levels, but the governing body retains oversight to ensure alignment with organizational objectives and priorities.

**Guiding Principles and Continual Improvement**:
- The ITIL guiding principles and continual improvement apply to all SVS components, including governance.
- The governing body can adopt ITIL guiding principles or define its own and communicate them across the organization.
- The governing body should have visibility of continual improvement outcomes and value measurement for the organization and its stakeholders.

**Key Requirements**:
- The service value chain and the organizationâ€™s practices must align with the governing body's direction.
- The governing body must maintain oversight of the SVS, either directly or through delegation.
- There should be alignment through a clear set of shared principles and objectives at all levels of governance and management.
- Governance and management must continually improve to meet stakeholder expectations.
