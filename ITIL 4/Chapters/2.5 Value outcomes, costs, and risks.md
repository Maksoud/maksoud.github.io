### Summary of Section 2.5: Value: Outcomes, Costs, and Risks

#### Key Message
Achieving desired outcomes involves resources (costs) and is associated with risks. Service providers help consumers achieve these outcomes, assuming some associated risks and costs. Service relationships are valuable when positive effects outweigh negatives.

#### 2.5.1 Outcomes
**Definitions**:
- **Output**: A tangible or intangible deliverable of an activity.
- **Outcome**: A result for a stakeholder enabled by one or more outputs.

**Explanation**:
- Service providers produce outputs to help consumers achieve desired outcomes. Understanding these outcomes can be complex and often requires collaboration between providers and consumers.

#### 2.5.2 Costs
**Definition**:
- **Cost**: The amount of money spent on a specific activity or resource.

**Types of Costs for Service Consumers**:
1. **Costs removed**: Expenses eliminated by the service (e.g., technology or staff costs).
2. **Costs imposed**: Expenses incurred from service consumption (e.g., training, network use).

**Importance**:
- Both types of costs are critical for assessing service value. Providers need a thorough understanding of service provision costs to ensure services meet budget and financial expectations.

#### 2.5.3 Risks
**Definition**:
- **Risk**: A possible event causing harm, loss, or difficulty in achieving objectives. It includes uncertainty of outcomes, both positive and negative.

**Types of Risks for Service Consumers**:
1. **Risks removed**: Reduced risks due to the service (e.g., hardware failure).
2. **Risks imposed**: New risks from service consumption (e.g., provider's business continuity).

**Provider's Role**:
- Providers manage risks on behalf of consumers, balancing what matters most to both parties. Consumers can aid in risk reduction by defining service requirements, communicating critical success factors, and providing necessary resources.

#### 2.5.4 Utility and Warranty
**Definitions**:
- **Utility**: Functionality offered by a service to meet a need. It determines if a service is "fit for purpose" by supporting performance or removing constraints.
- **Warranty**: Assurance that a service meets agreed requirements. It determines if a service is "fit for use" by addressing availability, capacity, security, and continuity.

**Assessment**:
- Evaluating a service involves considering how costs and risks impact its utility and warranty to ensure the service can deliver the desired outcomes and value.

**Example**:
- A theme park's rides provide utility by delivering excitement. However, frequent ride unavailability due to mechanical issues would fail to meet warranty standards, affecting overall value.

By understanding these concepts, organizations can better design, deliver, and manage services to create value for their consumers.
