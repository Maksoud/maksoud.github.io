### Summary of Section 2.3: Products and Services

#### Key Message
The central component of service management is the service. The nature of services and their relationship with products are fundamental to understanding service management.

#### 2.3.1 Configuring Resources for Value Creation
**Definitions**:
- **Service**: A means of enabling value co-creation by facilitating outcomes that customers want to achieve without the customer having to manage specific costs and risks.
- **Product**: A configuration of an organization’s resources designed to offer value for a consumer.

**Explanation**:
- Services provided by an organization are based on its products. Organizations possess various resources such as people, information, technology, value streams, processes, suppliers, and partners.
- Products are configurations of these resources that can potentially be valuable to customers.
- Each product is created with target consumer groups in mind, tailored to meet their needs.
- Products can address the needs of different consumer groups, such as offering different versions of software (e.g., a 'lite' version for individual users and a comprehensive version for corporate users).

#### 2.3.2 Service Offerings
**Definition**:
- **Service Offering**: A formal description of one or more services designed to address the needs of a target consumer group. It may include goods, access to resources, and service actions.

**Components of Service Offerings**:
1. **Goods**:
   - Supplied to the consumer, with ownership transferred to the consumer who then takes responsibility for future use.
   - Example: A mobile phone.
2. **Access to Resources**:
   - Ownership is not transferred. The consumer is granted access under agreed terms and conditions for a specific period.
   - Example: Access to a mobile network or network storage.
3. **Service Actions**:
   - Performed by the service provider to address the consumer’s needs according to the agreement.
   - Example: User support or equipment replacement.

**Explanation**:
- Service providers present their services through service offerings tailored to target consumer groups, which can be either internal or external to the provider organization.
- Different offerings can be created from the same product, addressing various consumer needs (e.g., a free version and a paid version of a software service).
