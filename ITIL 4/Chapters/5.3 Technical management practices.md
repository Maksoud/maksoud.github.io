### Summary of Section 5.3 Technical Management Practices

#### 5.3.1 Deployment Management

**Purpose**: To move new or changed hardware, software, documentation, processes, or other components to live environments. Deployment management can also be involved in deploying components to testing or staging environments.

**Key Points**:
- Deployment management works closely with release management and change control but is a separate practice.
- Approaches to deployment include:
  - **Phased Deployment**: Deploying components to part of the production environment at a time.
  - **Continuous Delivery**: Integrating, testing, and deploying components as needed.
  - **Big Bang Deployment**: Deploying components to all targets simultaneously.
  - **Pull Deployment**: Making new or changed software available in a controlled repository for users to download as needed.

**Tools and Communication**:
- Tools supporting deployment are often integrated with configuration management tools and may support audit and change management.
- Communication around deployments is part of release management.

#### 5.3.2 Infrastructure and Platform Management

**Purpose**: To oversee the infrastructure and platforms used by an organization. This includes monitoring technology solutions and managing IT infrastructure, which encompasses servers, storage, networks, client hardware, middleware, and operating systems software.

**Key Points**:
- The practice includes provisioning technology to support value-creating activities and being ready to adopt new technologies like machine learning, chatbots, and artificial intelligence.
- Organizations should develop their own cloud management systems to align infrastructure and platform components with business goals and intended service quality.

#### 5.3.3 Software Development and Management

**Purpose**: To ensure that applications meet internal and external stakeholder needs in terms of functionality, reliability, maintainability, compliance, and auditability.

**Key Points**:
- The term "software" includes a wide range of applications, from single programs to larger constructs like operating systems.
- Activities in this practice include:
  - Solution architecture and design
  - Software development and testing (unit testing, integration testing, regression testing, security testing, user acceptance testing)
  - Management of code repositories
  - Package creation for deployment
  - Version control and management of code blocks.

**Lifecycle**:
- Software management involves the ongoing design, testing, operation, and improvement of software applications.
- The software lifecycle includes stages from ideation to improvement and eventual retirement.

These technical management practices are integral to the efficient delivery and support of IT services, ensuring that technology resources are effectively deployed and managed to meet organizational needs and objectives.
