### Summary of Section 4.2: Opportunity, Demand, and Value

#### Key Message
Opportunity and demand are the driving forces that trigger activities within the ITIL Service Value System (SVS). These activities ultimately lead to the creation of value. Both opportunity and demand are continuously entering the system, but not all opportunities are accepted, nor is all demand satisfied.

#### Opportunity
Opportunity represents options or possibilities to add value for stakeholders or otherwise improve the organization. These options might not yet have generated demand but can still initiate work within the system. Organizations should prioritize services with improvement opportunities to ensure resources are properly allocated.

#### Demand
Demand represents the need or desire for products and services from both internal and external customers. Understanding demand helps organizations allocate resources and efforts to areas that will meet stakeholder needs effectively.

#### Value
The outcome of the SVS is value, which is the perceived benefits, usefulness, and importance of something. Value can be created for a wide group of stakeholders through various activities within the SVS.

This section underscores the importance of aligning organizational efforts with both opportunities and demand to continually create value for stakeholders.
