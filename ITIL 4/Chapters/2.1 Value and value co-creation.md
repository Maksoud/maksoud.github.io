### Summary of Section 2.1: Value and Value Co-Creation

#### Key Message
The purpose of an organization is to create value for stakeholders. The term "value" is central to service management and ITIL 4, and must be clearly defined.

**Definition: Value**
Value is the perceived benefits, usefulness, and importance of something. This definition acknowledges that value is subjective and depends on the stakeholders' perceptions, including customers, consumers, and service provider organizations.

#### 2.1.1 Value Co-Creation
In the past, organizations viewed their role as delivering value to customers in a one-way relationship, similar to delivering a package. This view ignored the complex, interdependent relationships between service providers and consumers.

Modern organizations recognize that value is co-created through active collaboration between providers, consumers, and other involved organizations. Providers no longer define value in isolation but engage in mutually beneficial relationships with consumers to co-create value.

**The ITIL Story: Value**
- **Marco**: Planning a new offering with an extra day of car hire with every booking.
- **Henri**: Emphasizes understanding the diverse requirements of Axle's broad customer base to ensure the service changes provide actual value.
- **Ichika**: Values freedom of movement and flexibility, but an extra day of car hire may not always suit her plans.
- **Faruq**: Values the on-demand availability of cars, aligning with his budget and flexible travel plans. An extra day of car hire offers real value to him.
- **Amelia**: Values the ability to reach customers and reduce costs and risks for her organization, Food for Fuel.

Henri concludes that value is created for both Axle and its customers through service relationships, balancing easy access to vehicles for consumers and revenue generation for Axle.

By understanding these concepts, organizations can better design, deliver, and manage services to create value for their consumers.
