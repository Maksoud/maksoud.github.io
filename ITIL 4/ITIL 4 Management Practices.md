The ITIL 4 framework introduces a comprehensive set of management practices designed to help organizations effectively manage and deliver IT services. These practices are grouped into three categories: General Management Practices, Service Management Practices, and Technical Management Practices.

### **General Management Practices**

These practices are adapted from general business management domains and can be applied to a wide range of activities beyond IT services. Key practices include:

1. **Continual Improvement**: Focuses on aligning and realigning an organization’s services to the changing business needs through incremental improvements or transformational changes.
2. **Information Security Management**: Ensures the protection of information needed by the organization to conduct its business.
3. **Relationship Management**: Establishes and nurtures the links between the organization and its stakeholders at strategic and tactical levels.
4. **Risk Management**: Identifies, assesses, and controls risks, ensuring that they do not adversely affect the organization’s ability to deliver services.
5. **Service Financial Management**: Supports the organization's financial policies and practices in managing IT services.

### **Service Management Practices**

These practices are specifically designed for managing IT services and include:

1. **Incident Management**: Manages the lifecycle of all incidents to ensure that normal service operation is restored as quickly as possible.
2. **Problem Management**: Prevents problems and resulting incidents from happening, eliminates recurring incidents, and minimizes the impact of incidents that cannot be prevented.
3. **Service Desk**: Provides a single point of contact between the service provider and users, handling a variety of service requests and incidents.
4. **Service Level Management**: Sets clear business-based targets for service performance, ensuring that delivery is measured and managed according to those targets.
5. **Change Control**: Ensures that changes are recorded and evaluated, and that authorized changes are prioritized, planned, tested, implemented, documented, and reviewed in a controlled manner.

### **Technical Management Practices**

These practices are adapted from technology management and include:

1. **Deployment Management**: Moves new or changed hardware, software, documentation, processes, or any other component to live environments.
2. **Infrastructure and Platform Management**: Oversees the underlying technology infrastructure that supports the organization’s services.
3. **Software Development and Management**: Ensures that applications meet internal and external stakeholders' needs in terms of functionality and performance.

### **Integration and Application**

ITIL 4 emphasizes that these practices should not be used in isolation but integrated within the Service Value System (SVS) to support holistic service management. They interact with the Service Value Chain and other components of the SVS to create value for stakeholders continuously.

### **Conclusion**

The ITIL 4 management practices offer a structured approach to managing IT services, ensuring alignment with business goals, efficient service delivery, and continual improvement. By applying these practices, organizations can enhance their ability to meet the needs of their customers and adapt to the rapidly changing IT landscape.
