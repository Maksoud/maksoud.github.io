### Summary of Section 2.4: Service Relationships

#### Key Message
Service relationships are fundamental for value co-creation between organizations. These relationships involve cooperation between service providers and service consumers, where organizations can simultaneously take on both roles.

#### Service Relationship Model
Service relationships are established to create or modify resources for service consumers, which they can then use to address the needs of other target consumer groups. This creates a cyclical interaction where organizations can both consume and provide services.

**Examples**:
- A training service improves the skills of the consumer’s employees.
- A broadband service enables communication for the consumer’s computers.
- A car-hire service allows the consumer’s staff to visit clients.
- A software development service creates a new application for the service consumer.

#### Definitions
- **Service Relationship**: A cooperation between a service provider and service consumer, encompassing service provision, service consumption, and service relationship management.
- **Service Provision**: Activities performed to provide services, including managing resources, ensuring access, fulfilling agreed actions, service level management, and continual improvement. It may also include supplying goods.
- **Service Consumption**: Activities performed to consume services, including managing necessary resources, performing service actions, and receiving goods.
- **Service Relationship Management**: Joint activities to ensure continual value co-creation based on agreed and available service offerings.

#### Service Relationship Dynamics
The service relationship model illustrates that when services are delivered, they either create new resources for the consumer or modify existing ones. This enables the consumer to create their own products and become a service provider to another group, thus perpetuating the cycle of service provision and consumption.
