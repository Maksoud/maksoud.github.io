The Service Value Chain (SVC) is a key component of the ITIL 4 framework, representing the set of interconnected activities that an organization performs to deliver valuable products and services to its customers. The SVC is central to the ITIL 4 Service Value System (SVS) and is designed to be flexible and adaptable to different types of service organizations and scenarios.

### Core Activities of the Service Value Chain

1. **Plan**: Ensures a shared understanding of the vision, current status, and improvement direction for all four dimensions and all products and services across the organization.
2. **Improve**: Aims at continual improvement of products, services, and practices across all value chain activities and the four dimensions of service management.
3. **Engage**: Provides a good understanding of stakeholder needs, continuous engagement, and transparency, ensuring that stakeholders’ expectations are understood and met.
4. **Design & Transition**: Ensures that products and services continually meet stakeholder expectations for quality, costs, and time-to-market.
5. **Obtain/Build**: Ensures that service components are available when and where they are needed, and meet agreed specifications.
6. **Deliver & Support**: Ensures that services are delivered and supported according to agreed specifications and stakeholders’ expectations.

### Integration and Flow

Each activity within the Service Value Chain is designed to transform inputs into outputs that collectively create value for stakeholders. The integration of these activities supports the continual flow of value, from understanding and defining demand to delivering services and enhancing them through feedback and improvement.

- **Flexibility**: The SVC allows for flexibility in how these activities are combined and executed, adapting to the specific needs of the organization and the services being provided.
