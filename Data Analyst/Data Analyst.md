## Switching carrer path

Switching to a career in data science is an exciting move! Here's a breakdown of what you should focus on to prepare:

- First, solidify your understanding of **mathematics and statistics**. These are foundational to data science, especially in areas like probability, linear algebra, and statistical methods.
- Next, learn to code, focusing on languages commonly used in data science. **Python** is the most popular, but **R** is also valuable, especially for statistical analysis. Get comfortable with libraries and frameworks such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **scikit-learn**, and **TensorFlow**.
- Understand and practice **data manipulation and cleaning**. You'll spend a lot of time preparing data, so skills in handling missing data, transforming variables, and normalizing datasets are crucial. **SQL** is essential for database management and query.
- Get familiar with **data visualization** tools and techniques. Libraries like **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and tools like **Tableau** or **Power BI** are useful for presenting your findings.
- Dive into **machine learning**. Learn the basics of supervised and unsupervised learning, and explore various algorithms like regression, clustering, and decision trees. Resources like **Coursera**, **edX**, and **Kaggle** are excellent for practical learning and competitions.
- Understand **big data technologies** if you're interested in working with large datasets. Learn about tools and frameworks like **Hadoop**, **Spark**, and **Kafka**.
- Develop your **soft skills**, such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and communication. Data scientists often need to explain complex concepts to non-technical stakeholders.
- Lastly, work on **real projects**. Build a portfolio by working on datasets from places like Kaggle, participating in hackathons, or contributing to open-source projects. This hands-on experience is invaluable and showcases your skills to potential employers.

## Finding Hackatons

You can find hackathons for data scientists through several platforms and communities:

1. **Kaggle**: Kaggle regularly hosts data science competitions and hackathons where you can work on real-world datasets and problems.
2. **Major League Hacking (MLH)**: MLH organizes various hackathons, including those focused on data science.
3. **Devpost**: Devpost lists a wide range of hackathons, including those specifically for data science and machine learning.
4. **GitHub**: Sometimes, data science communities and organizations host hackathons and announce them on GitHub.
5. **Local Meetups and Tech Communities**: Websites like [Meetup.com](http://meetup.com/) and Eventbrite often list local hackathons. Check for data science and machine learning groups in your area.
6. **Universities and Educational Platforms**: Institutions like Coursera, edX, and Udacity sometimes host hackathons or competitions as part of their courses.
7. **Social Media**: Follow data science communities and influencers on Twitter, LinkedIn, and Reddit. They often share information about upcoming hackathons.
8. **Company and Organization Websites**: Companies like Google, Microsoft, and Facebook, as well as organizations like Data Science Society, often host hackathons and list them on their websites.

By participating in these hackathons, you can gain practical experience, network with other data scientists, and showcase your skills.

## Defining a strategy to follow

Given your extensive background in software development and IT analysis, you likely already possess many of the analytical and technical skills needed for data analysis. Transitioning to a data analyst role might take around three to six months of dedicated learning and practice. Here's a rough outline:

1. **Learn the Tools**: Since you're familiar with programming, learning data analysis tools like Python (with libraries like Pandas, NumPy) or R should be relatively quick.
2. **Statistical Analysis**: Brush up on statistical concepts if needed. There are many online courses that can get you up to speed in a few weeks.
3. **Data Visualization**: Familiarize yourself with tools like Tableau, Power BI, or visualization libraries in Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn). This might take a month or two to get comfortable.
4. **SQL**: If you're not already proficient, learn SQL for querying databases. Given your background, this should be straightforward.
5. **Practice with Real Data**: Work on projects, participate in online competitions (like on Kaggle), or find datasets to analyze. Practical experience is crucial and might take a couple of months to build a strong portfolio.

Combining these efforts, you could be ready for a data analyst role within three to six months, depending on your learning pace and the time you dedicate to it. Your background as a developer and IT analyst will significantly shorten the learning curve.
